## Deployment

1. Extract the archive and put it in the folder you want
2. Run cp .env.example .env file to copy example file to .env ( vim .env / :wq -> save ) Then edit your .env file with DB credentials and other settings.
3. Run composer install command (php composer.phar install )
4. Run php artisan migrate --seed command. Notice: seed is important, because it will create the first admin user for you.
